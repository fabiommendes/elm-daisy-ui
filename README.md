# DaisyUI components

This module wraps some Daisy UI components used in some of my personal projects.  


## Installation

Install it in your project with 

    elm install fabiommendes/elm-daisy-ui


## Example

The code is organized grouping elements similarly to the sections in DaisyUI documentation. If an element requires
state (like Tabs, Carousels or Accordions), it is always wrapped in its own module, which follows the Elm architecture.
